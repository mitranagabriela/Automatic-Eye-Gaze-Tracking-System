# Automatic Eye Gaze Tracking System
___________________________________________________

Tracking the eye gaze is a difficult task as each application has its own limitations and constraints.
The image dataset used for training and testing the classification model cannot be shared as I signed a NDA with the University and all the parties involved.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient and robust algorithm method to determine the eye gaze, having to choose from six possibilities. 

In my research I analyse two different techniques for detecting the facial features and implement an LBP descriptor for obtaining information about the eye area. The classifier is trained and tested against the EyeChimera dataset (Eye part from the Cognitive process Inference by the Mutual use of the Eye and expRession Analysis).

My paper is also focused on optimizing the model’s parameters in order to achieve a high accuracy for detecting the eye gaze.

Research question:
1. How does the tracking method depend on subjects’ characteristics?

Key findings:
1. I was able to implement an efficient and robust algorithm for detecting the eye gaze. 
2. The results concluded that the accuracy of the model depends on the subject’s characteristics, on how visible is the eye area, but also on different directions of the eye. The model achieved the highest accuracy for the central eye gaze.
3. The HOG descriptor for the facial features provided a much higher accuracy.

My research also offered insights on how the model can be improved for further use. 

Conclusion:
I can conclude that I have accomplished my research goal by developing an algorithm that automatically detects the eye gaze.
